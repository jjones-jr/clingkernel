# Cling Kernel

C++ Kernel for Jupyter with Cling.

You will probably need to specify the path to cling with the `CLING_EXE` env variable.

**Note:** This currently requires master of everything IPython and Jupyter because that's what I use,
but I'll clean that up so it works on 3.x.

## Install

To install the kernel:

    jupyter-kernelspec install cling

or for IPython/Jupyter < 4:

    ipython kernelspec install cling
